# Project 5: Neighborhood Map
### by Luis Michilot

# Project Overview
Develop a single page application (responsive) featuring a map of my neighborhood, adding functionality to include a map with markers about some parks near me ðŸŒ³ ðŸŒ².

The app allows you to filter the list of parks when you type in. In return, it displays the locations on the map.

There's also extra information returned from Foursquare where available. This includes address, city and postal code.
